# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
🎮 Missionaries & Cannibals Puzzle Game

📌 About the Project

This is a classic river-crossing puzzle built using React & Framer Motion. The goal of the game is to move all missionaries and cannibals across the river while ensuring that the missionaries are never outnumbered by the cannibals on either side.

🛠️ Tech Stack

React ⚛️ - Frontend Framework

🎯 Game Rules

The boat can hold up to 2 people at a time.

Cannibals should never outnumber missionaries on any side, otherwise, the game is lost.

The goal is to safely transport all 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals to the other side.

Click on characters to move them into or out of the boat.

Click on the boat to move it across the river.

🕹️ How to Play?

Start with 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals on the left bank.

Click on characters to place them in the boat.

Move the boat to the other side by clicking on it.

Continue until all characters reach the right bank safely.

Avoid a scenario where cannibals outnumber missionaries on any side.
